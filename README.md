Job search can be fun. This is the time when you have an in depth understanding of yourself, your past experience, and your future plans.
Most of all, you will study and become a better person. 
After three months of job searching, you may say "I am more knowledgeable than me three months ago"

### Here is the process of job search

```flow
st=>start: Google "How to land a job in software engineering" 
e=>end: offered
op1=>operation: Write resume/cover letter
op2=>operation: Apply for jobs
cond1=>condition: Get interviews?
op3=>operation: Prepare for interviews
op4=>operation: Boost resume/cover letter

## How to crack the interview
### Prepare for incoming interviews

- company search. Basical questions "why do you wanna work here"
- Search for interviews questions from those platfrom Glassdoor/Google/leetcode/1point3acres 
    coding questions are arbitrary. but you will get an idea of the difficulty of the problem
- email HR about the process and content of the interview
- Review your notes about coding templates such as binary search, quicksort, mergesort
Based on my several interviews, people like to ask questions on array(interval) or string
- prepare BQ
- Mock interview from educating.io, pramp
    
Typical interview process
    1 round HR phone screen
    1 round technical screen
    Virtual onsite 3 ~ 4
        data structure / algorithm/ leetcode
        OOD
        BQ
    Last round Hiring Manager ask about your project technical details
    
### During the interview

### Post interview

### Coding Questions
Leetcode
Cracking the coding interview

### Behavior Questions
A typical behavior questions is "tell me a time when you met a challenge/failure/success"

Reasons for Behavior questions
- Verify your past experience. You did what you said on resume
- Know how big your accomplishment is
- Know your skills and attributes for the job


All those questions can be well prepared before the interview

1. Brainstorm all your experiences from work experience, project, extracurricular
2. Create a Preparation Grid and write down as many stories as possible that covers at least one area (Leadership/Teamwork/Successes/Challanges/Mistakes)

||Job1|Job2|Project1|Extracurricular1|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|Leadership|||||
|Teamwork|||||
|Successes|||||
|Challanges|||||
|Mistakes|||||
|Others|||||

3. Master 5 best stories from your experience 
How to define a good story?
- The story shows that your accomplishment is substantial such as optimize/create something or solve an problem.
- The story is easy to understand, less technical.
- The story shows interviewers your good personalities such as creativity/curiosity/understanding/anaytical/data-driven/leadership/influence others
- The story is about you, not teams

4. Structure your story with S.A.R (Situation, Action, Result)

    Start your story with a topic sentence such as "The challenge I met is that how to shorten the query time in data warehouses". 
    
    Then organize your story with S.A.R structure 
    - Situation: background and why it mattered 
    - Action: the action you took to handle the challenge/failure/leadership/success. You can speak in bullets. First, .... Second, .... Third, ... 
    - Result: how your actions help the team and company? If it is possible, try to quantify your impact.

5. Practice
    - Practice with peers
    - Practice on Pramp

Follow-up questions
- What do you learn from this?
- What would you do differently if the this situation came up again?
- How the team react?
